                                          Instructions for pico-w

First step, get the pico ready to work by installing the corresponding tools.
Then, onnect the pins of dht11 (Vcc, GND, Data) with the pins of our raspberry pi pico using the cables and the breadboard.
Use an editor to write code and test the results using the terminal

( Running dht11.py & dht.py will display the data of the weather on the terminal ( in this part we used Thonny editor to test our code) )

- DHT11 is used to measure the humidity and temperature to predict weather conditiond
